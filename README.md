# WelcomeTo...Automatic
An automatic card handle for the game Welcome To. (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233867/welcome)

In order to play it is needed:
1. A printed scoreboard (available in pdf)
2. A card generator. That can be:
  - The Excel sheet with macros .  Remember to allow macros when opening the file. (Could give errors in old Excel Versions)
  - The Android app

Enjoy!
